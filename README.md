# ElectricityDemandwithLockdownVictoria
In this project, we mainly evaluate the impact on electricity demand from lockdown policy in Victoria, Australia.
We describe some specific pattern based on our data analysis, and create some predictors to model the demand series.
Then, we employ S-ARIMA-X model to fit the investigated data with all considered predictos/
Finally, we quantify the daily and weekly impacts for assisting the demand forecasting during the COVID-19 pandemic.
